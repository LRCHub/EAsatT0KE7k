[Verse 1]
Under pressure you are waiting for the direction
Going on the road without your mind
All mislead they give ignoring out all decisions
Killing yourself your soul we have inside
No one else but you are I'm waiting for
We can start it on just right here right now
Fear and circulation
But I am ready now
We can struggle and muzzle the world before it fades away
[Chorus]
Raise your flag
声の限り, 声の限り
声の限り叫んで
きっといつか , いつか何処か
辿り着くと信じて
Come on and raise your flag
So just raise your flag
何度くじけ迷えど
息の限り 続く限り
夢を見続け彷徨う
[Verse 2]
All mistakes I made are blurring my reflection
And it is more than I achieved so far
Taking this ship or not depends on your intention
To be the soldier or one bystander
あがき続け　倒れくじけ
這い上がって走り続けて
終わりなき 夢の間と間
We can struggle and muzzle the world before it fades away
[Chorus]
Raise your flag
声の限り, 声の限り
声の限り叫んで
きっといつか , いつか何処か
辿り着くと信じて
Come on and raise your flag
So just raise your flag
何度くじけ迷えど
息の限り 続く限り
夢を見続け彷徨う

[Bridge]
When is the time?
It's up to your own decision
The time to find
To struggle and prove our vision
When is the time?
To end all the false collision
The time to find
And we'll move to the new division
When is the time?
It's up to your own decision
The time to find
To struggle and prove our vision
So raise your flag
So raise your flag
So raise your flag
And we'll move to the new division
[Chorus]
Raise your flag
声の限り, 声の限り
声の限り叫んで
きっといつか , いつか何処か
辿り着くと信じて
Come on and raise your flag
So just raise your flag
何度くじけ迷えど
息の限り 続く限り
夢を見続け彷徨う
